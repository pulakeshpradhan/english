# Part 10: Pronunciation

!!! tip "The Output Engine"
    **Objective:** Calibrate vocal output for clarity and native-level signal transmission.

## 1. The Vowel Spectrogram

* **Short vs Long:** *Sit* (Short I) vs *Seat* (Long E).
* **Schwa (/ə/):** The Neutral Sound. Most unstressed syllables become this.
  * *Example:* "Teach**er**", "Banan**a**".

## 2. The TH Actuator

* **Voiceless (/θ/):** Air only. *Think, Thank, Three*.
* **Voiced (/ð/):** Vibration. *This, That, Those*.
* **Drill:** Stick tongue between teeth. Do not produce 'S' or 'Z'.

## 3. The Intonation Wave

* **Falling Pitch:** Statements. "I like coffee $\searrow$."
* **Rising Pitch:** Yes/No Questions. "Do you like coffee $\nearrow$?"
* **Stress Timing:** English is stress-timed. Stressed syllables are longer; unstressed are compressed.
  * *Robot Code (Wrong):* "I-want-to-go-to-the-store."
  * *Fluent Code:* "Ia-wanna-**GO**-tda-**STORE**."

## 4. The Linking Protocol

* **Consonant + Vowel:** "Clean up" $\rightarrow$ "Clee-nup".
* **Vowel + Vowel:** "Do it" $\rightarrow$ "Do-wit".
* **T-Flap (American):** "Water" $\rightarrow$ "Wader".
