# The GRAMMAR Codes

## 1-S-1-I Protocol (Structure)

!!! tip "The Universal Rule"
    **1-S-1-I:** A sentence must have **1 Subject** and **1 Idea**.

### The Problem: "Subject Overload"

A run-on sentence happens when you pack two subjects/ideas into one space without a divider.

> *Bad Code:* "I went to the beach yesterday, it was hot."
>
> **Error:** Two subjects (**I** and **It**) = Two sentences needed.

### The Trap: "The Comma Splice"

Never glue two independent ideas with just a distinct comma. It is too weak to hold them.

> *Bad Code:* "I bought milk, it was expensive."

### The Fix Kit: P-S-C

Use the **P-S-C** method to repair run-ons:

1. **P - Period (The Hard Stop):**
    * Separate them completely.
    * *Result:* "The model is accurate**.** It predicts floods well."
2. **S - Semicolon (The Soft Link):**
    * Link related ideas with a semicolon + transition.
    * *Result:* "The model is accurate**; therefore,** it predicts floods well."
3. **C - Conjunction (The Glue):**
    * Use a comma + FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So).
    * *Result:* "The model is accurate**, so** it predicts floods well."

## The S-W-A-P Matrix (Vocabulary)

!!! info "The Standard"
    **Rule:** If you say it in a text message, **SWAP** it for the Academic Standard.

### Tier 1: The "Lazy Words" Swap

These words are vague fillers. Swap them for precision.

| Informal (Delete This) | Formal (Write This) | The Upgrade Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **So** | Extremely / Very | "The results were **extremely** significant." |
| **Just** | Only / Simply | "The study used **only** two variables." |
| **Way / A lot** | Many / Much | "The error was **much** lower." |
| **Kind of** | Somewhat | "The trend was **somewhat** linear." |
| **Big** | Significant | "The difference was **significant**." |
| **Good** | Robust | "The method proved **robust**." |
| **Bad** | Poor | "The data quality was **poor**." |

### Tier 2: The "Chatty Words" Swap

These words sound like speech. Swap them for writing.

| Informal (Delete This) | Formal (Write This) | The Upgrade Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Get** | Obtain / Receive | "We **obtained** the satellite data." |
| **Of course** | Clearly / Evidently | "The pattern **clearly** indicates stress." |
| **Awesome** | Incredible | "The accuracy was **incredible**." |
| **Again and Again** | Repeatedly | "The test failed **repeatedly**." |
| **Whole** | Entire | "The **entire** study area." |
| **Kids** | Children | "The **children** were surveyed." |
| **Show** | Illustrate | "Figure 1 **illustrates** the trend." |
| **Look at** | Examine | "We **examined** the samples." |
| **Talk about** | Discuss | "This section **discusses** the results." |

### Tier 3: The "Weak Links" Swap

These phrases dilute your authority.

| Informal (Delete This) | Formal (Write This) | The Upgrade Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On the other hand** | Contrastingly | "**Contrastingly**, the new method is faster." |
| **Got to** | Must / Need to | "We **must** verify the data." |
| **Ask** | Enquire | "We will **enquire** about the dataset." |
| **Used to** | Accustomed to | "The system is **accustomed to** noise." |
| **In a nutshell** | Briefly | "**Briefly**, the process involves..." |
| **Lots of** | Numerous | "There are **numerous** factors." |
| **Sort of** | Partially | "The hypothesis was **partially** supported." |

## The B-R-I-D-G-E System (Transitions)

!!! tip "The Flow Rule"
    **Rule:** Never leave a sentence stranded. Build a **BRIDGE** to the next idea.

### Bridge Types

Select the right bridge for your logic path:

* **(+) THE ADDER:** Adds more of the same.
  * *Code:* **In addition, Moreover, Furthermore.**
* **(-) THE CONTRASTER:** Changes direction.
  * *Code:* **However, Conversely, Although, In contrast.**
* **(=) THE RESULT:** Shows the output.
  * *Code:* **Therefore, Consequently, Thus, As a result.**
* **(>) THE SEQUENCER:** Shows order.
  * *Code:* **First, Next, Finally.**

### The Punctuation Key

When using a Bridge Word, remember the Punctuation Code:

> **[Punctuator] + [Bridge Word] + [Comma]**

* *Option A:* The test failed**. However,** we tried again.
* *Option B:* The test failed**; however,** we tried again.

## The A-C-T-I-V-E Switch (Voice)

!!! tip "The Agency Rule"
    **Rule:** Focus on the **Actor**, not the Action. Active voice creates stronger, clearer sentences.

### The Passive Trap

Passive voice makes sentences weak and wordy. It hides who is doing the work.

> *Weak Code:* "The survey was conducted by the research team."
>
> **Critique:** The actor (team) is at the end. It lacks energy.

### The Active Fix

Flip the sentence. Put the actor first.

> *Strong Code:* "The research team conducted the survey."
>
> **Why:** It is direct, concise, and powerful.

### When to use Passive?

Only use passive when the actor is unknown, irrelevant, or obvious.

* *Correct:* "The samples were stored at -20°C." (Who stored them doesn't matter; the temperature matters).

## The P-A-R-A-L-L-E-L Rails (Consistency)

!!! tip "The Pattern Rule"
    **Rule:** Items in a list or comparison must follow the same grammatical pattern (noun-noun, verb-verb).

### The Mismatch Error

Mixing verbs, nouns, and phrases breaks the flow and confuses the reader.

> *Bad Code:* "The goals are to reduce waste, increasing efficiency, and cost management."
>
> **Error:** Three distinct forms (Infinitive phrase, Gerund, Noun phrase).

### The Parallel Fix

Make them match. Align the rails.

> *Good Code:* "The goals are to **reduce** waste, **increase** efficiency, and **manage** costs." (All Verbs).
>
> *Alternative:* "The goals are waste reduction, efficiency increase, and cost management." (All Nouns).
