!!! tip "The Dependency Rule"
    **Rule:** IF [Condition] is met, THEN [Result] executes.

## 1. Zero Conditional (The Axiom)

* **Logic:** 100% Probability. Universal Truths.
* **Syntax:** `If + Present Simple, Present Simple`
* **Code:** "If you **heat** ice, it **melts**."
* **Use Cases:** Scientific facts, rules, instructions.

## 2. First Conditional (The Prediction)

* **Logic:** >50% Probability. Real possibility.
* **Syntax:** `If + Present Simple, Will + Verb`
* **Code:** "If it **rains**, I **will stay** home."
* **Use Cases:** Future plans, warnings, promises.

## 3. Second Conditional (The Hypothetical)

* **Logic:** 0-1% Probability. Imaginary Present/Future.
* **Syntax:** `If + Past Simple, Would + Verb`

* **Use Cases:** Dreams, advice ("If I were you...").

## 4. Third Conditional (The Regret)

* **Logic:** 0% Probability. Impossible Past.
* **Syntax:** `If + Past Perfect, Would Have + V3`
* **Code:** "If I **had studied**, I **would have passed**."
* **Use Cases:** Regrets, alternative past outcomes.
