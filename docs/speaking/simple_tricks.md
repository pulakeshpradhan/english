# Simple Tricks to Improve Your English

Small changes that make a big difference in your communication, from the [Simple Tricks Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzVm1SmjPKc_OnC56Bb5G2jhqDA_UNAOZ).

## Quick Tips

### 1. "Actually"

- Use "actually" to correct something politely or add surprising information, not just as a filler.

### 2. "Like"

- While native speakers overuse "like," overusing it yourself can sound unprofessional. Use "such as" or "for example" instead.

### 3. Avoiding "Very"

- **Very good** -> **Excellent**
- **Very bad** -> **Awful**
- **Very tired** -> **Exhausted**
- **Very hungry** -> **Starving**

### 4. Body Language

- Smile when you speak (it changes your voice tone).
- Maintain eye contact.
- Use hand gestures naturally (but don't overdo it).

These small adjustments drastically improve perceived fluency.
