# Academic Vocabulary & Flow

## Formal vs. Informal Vocabulary

Academic writing demands a formal tone. Words that are acceptable in speech often sound unprofessional in writing.

### Very Informal Words to Avoid

| Informal Word | Formal Correction | Example | Corrected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **So** | Very, Extremely | *The movie was so good.* | *The movie was **very** good.* |
| **Just** | Only, Simply | *There are just three students.* | *There are **only** three students.* |
| **Way, A lot** | Many, Much | *He is way better.* | *He is **much** better.* |
| **Kind of** | Somewhat | *It kind of looks like X.* | *It **somewhat** looks like X.* |

### Informal Words

| Informal Word | Formal Correction | Example | Corrected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Get** | Obtain, Receive | *I got the data.* | *I **obtained** the data.* |
| **Of course** | Clearly, Evidently | *Of course it rained.* | *It **evidently** rained.* |
| **Awesome** | Significant | *The results were awesome.* | *The results were **significant**.* |
| **Again and again** | Repeatedly | *We tested again and again.* | *We tested **repeatedly**.* |
| **Whole** | Entire | *The whole day.* | *The **entire** day.* |
| **All right, OK** | Acceptable | *The model is OK.* | *The model is **acceptable**.* |

### Somewhat Informal Words

| **Ask** | Enquire / Inquire | *I want to ask...* | *I would like to **enquire**...* |

## Reporting Verbs

When citing previous research, "said" is rarely sufficient. Use reporting verbs to convey precise meaning and your stance toward the citation.

| Strength | Verb | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neutral** | **States, Notes, Discusses** | Standard attribution. ("Smith (2020) **states** that...") |
| **Suggestive** | **Suggests, Proposes, Implies** | When the author is tentative. ("Jones (2019) **suggests** a link...") |
| **Strong** | **Argues, Claims, Asserts** | When the author is making a strong point. ("Lee (2021) **argues** that...") |
| **Evidence-based** | **Demonstrates, Shows, Found** | When presenting data/findings. ("Data **demonstrates** a significant rise...") |

## Eliminating Wordiness (Conciseness)

Academic writing should be concise. Remove redundant phrases ("deadwood").

| Wordy Phrase | Precise Replacement |
| :--- | :--- |
| Due to the fact that | Because |
| In order to | To |
| Has the capability to | Can |
| Making a decision | Deciding |
| In the event of | If |
| At this point in time | Now / Currently |
| A large number of | Many / Numerous |

## Latin Abbreviations

These are common but must be used correctly.

* **e.g.** (*exempli gratia*): "For example." Use inside parentheses.
  * *Usage:* "Many variables (e.g., age, height, weight) were measured."
* **i.e.** (*id est*): "That is" or "In other words." It clarifies, doesn't list examples.
  * *Usage:* "The solstice (i.e., the longest day) occurs in June."
* **et al.** (*et alia*): "And others." Used for citations with multiple authors. Note the period after "al".
  * *Usage:* "Smith et al. (2020) found..."
* **etc.** (*et cetera*): "And so forth." Avoid in formal writing; use "and others" or a specific list instead.

## Transitional Words

Transitional words are the bridges between your ideas. They ensure logical flow and coherence.

| Purpose | Most Popular | Other Options |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Adding New Ideas** | In addition, Also | Moreover, additionally, furthermore |
| **Contrasting** | However | Yet, nevertheless, conversely, despite |
| **Cause & Effect** | Therefore | As a result, accordingly, consequently, thus |
| **Comparing** | Likewise | Similarly, correspondingly |
| **Introducing Examples** | For example | For instance, as an example |
| **Concluding** | In conclusion | To summarize, in summary, finally |
| **Sequence** | First, second, then | Next, finally |

### Punctuation Rules for Transitions

Transitional words usually follow a period or semicolon and are immediately followed by a comma.

1. *I like pizza. **However,** I don't like pepperoni.*
2. *I like pizza; **however,** I don't like pepperoni.*

## Writer's Checklist

Before submitting your manuscript, check the following:

* [ ] **Subjects:** Does every sentence have one clear subject and idea?
* [ ] **Tone:** Have you purged "so", "just", "kids", and "get"?
* [ ] **Spelling:** Checked for specific errors (e.g., dropping 'e' before -ing)?
* [ ] **Structure:** Are transitions used to connect paragraphs logically?
* [ ] **Flow:** Do sentences vary in length to avoid monotony, while remaining direct?
