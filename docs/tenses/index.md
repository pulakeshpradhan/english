# English Tenses Overview

Tenses are the backbone of English communication. They tell us **when** an action happens (Time) and **how** it happens (Aspect).

## The Time Frames

English has three main time frames:

1. **Past**: Before now.
2. **Present**: Now (or generally true).
3. **Future**: After now.

## The Aspects

Each time frame has four aspects:

1. **Simple**: Facts, habits, or complete actions.
2. **Continuous (Progressive)**: Ongoing actions, in progress.
3. **Perfect**: Connections between times (e.g., past affecting present).
4. **Perfect Continuous**: Focus on duration or the process of an action.

## Quick Reference Table

| Aspect | Past | Present | Future |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple** | I walked | I walk | I will walk |
| **Continuous** | I was walking | I am walking | I will be walking |
| **Perfect** | I had walked | I have walked | I will have walked |
| **Perfect Continuous** | I had been walking | I have been walking | I will have been walking |

## Learning Path
