# The TIME Codes (Tenses)

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=pBlue!10, colframe=pBlue, title=\textbf{The Timeline Protocol}]
\textbf{Objective:} Map every action to a precise coordinate on the Time Axis (Past, Present, Future).
\end{tcolorbox}

## 1. The Present Sector {-}
*Usage:* Current operating state or universal truths.

### Simple Present (The Constant)
*   **Logic:** $Time = Now$ (Habitual/Fact).
*   **Code:** "I **write** code."
*   **Use Cases:** routines, facts, scheduled events.

### Present Continuous (The Process)
*   **Logic:** $Time = In Progress$.
*   **Code:** "I **am writing** code."
*   **Use Cases:** actions happening now, temporary situations.

### Present Perfect (The Bridge)
*   **Logic:** $Past \rightarrow Present$ Link.
*   **Code:** "I **have written** the code."
*   **Use Cases:** unspecified past time, result is relevant now.

### Present Perfect Continuous (The Duration)
*   **Logic:** $Start \rightarrow Now$ (Ongoing).
*   **Code:** "I **have been writing** for 2 hours."
*   **Use Cases:** emphasis on duration of simple activity.

## 2. The Past Sector {-}
*Usage:* Archived data.

### Simple Past (The Archive)
*   **Logic:** $Time = Finished$.
*   **Code:** "I **wrote** the code yesterday."
*   **Use Cases:** completed actions at specific time.

### Past Continuous (The Background)
*   **Logic:** $Time = Interrupted/Parallel$.
*   **Code:** "I **was writing** when the bug appeared."
*   **Use Cases:** setting the scene, interrupted actions.

### Past Perfect (The Pre-History)
*   **Logic:** $Event A < Event B$.
*   **Code:** "I **had written** the code before the meeting."
*   **Use Cases:** action before another past action.

### Past Perfect Continuous (The Pre-Duration)
*   **Logic:** $Duration \rightarrow Past Event$.
*   **Code:** "I **had been writing** for hours when it crashed."
*   **Use Cases:** cause of a past state.

## 3. The Future Sector {-}
*Usage:* Predicted or Planned data.

### Simple Future (The Prediction)
*   **Logic:** $Time \rightarrow Future$.
*   **Code:** "I **will write** the code."
*   **Use Cases:** instant decisions, predictions (will), plans (going to).

### Future Continuous (The Schedule)
*   **Logic:** $Time = In Progress (Future)$.
*   **Code:** "I **will be writing** at 8 PM."
*   **Use Cases:** fixed future events.

### Future Perfect (The Deadline)
*   **Logic:** $Done < Future Time$.
*   **Code:** "I **will have written** it by noon."
*   **Use Cases:** completion by a specific future time.

### Future Perfect Continuous (The Milestone)
*   **Logic:** $Duration \rightarrow Future Time$.
*   **Code:** "I **will have been writing** for 10 years by 2030."
*   **Use Cases:** duration at a future point.
