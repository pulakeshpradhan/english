## The Tense Framework (Time Logic)

!!! tip "The Timeline Protocol"
    **Objective:** Map every action to a precise coordinate on the Time Axis (Past, Present, Future).

### 1. The Simple States

*Usage:* Facts, Habits, and Completed Actions.

* **Present Simple:** Routine code.
  * *Code:* "I **write** code every day." (Habit)
* **Past Simple:** Archived code.
  * *Code:* "I **wrote** the script yesterday." (Finished)
* **Future Simple:** Projected code.
  * *Code:* "I **will write** the report tomorrow." (Prediction/Decision)

### 2. The Continuous Flows

*Usage:* Actions in progress / Temporary states.

* **Present Continuous:** Running code.
  * *Code:* "I **am writing** right now."
* **Past Continuous:** Interrupted code.
  * *Code:* "I **was writing** when the power failed."
* **Future Continuous:** Background code.
  * *Code:* "I **will be writing** at 8 PM."

### 3. The Perfect Bridges

*Usage:* Connecting Past to Present, or Past to Past.

* **Present Perfect:** The "Result" Bridge.
  * *Code:* "I **have written** the email." (Action is done, but result is crucial now).
  * *Key:* Don't mention *when*. Mention *what*.
* **Past Perfect:** The "Pre-History" Bridge.
  * *Code:* "I **had written** the email before he called." (Action 1 happened before Action 2).

## The Conditional Logic (If/Then)

!!! tip "The Dependency Rule"
    **Rule:** IF [Condition] is met, THEN [Result] executes.

### Type 0: The Universal Truth

*Logic:* 100% Probability. Facts.

* *Structure:* If + Present, Present.
* *Code:* "If you **heat** ice, it **melts**."

### Type 1: The Real Possibility

*Logic:* >50% Probability. Future plans.

* *Structure:* If + Present, Future (will).
* *Code:* "If it **rains**, I **will stay** home."

### Type 2: The Hypothetical (Present/Future)

*Logic:* 0-1% Probability. Dreams/Imagination.

* *Structure:* If + Past, Would + Verb.
* *Code:* "If I **won** the lottery, I **would buy** an island."

### Type 3: The Regret (Past)

*Logic:* 0% Probability. It's too late.

* *Structure:* If + Past Perfect, Would have + V3.
* *Code:* "If I **had studied**, I **would have passed**."

## The Modal Operators (Permissions)

### Probability Matrix

* **Must:** 100% Certainty. "It **must** be true."
* **Should:** Advice/Recommendation. "You **should** check the logs."
* **Could / Might:** Possibility (<50%). "It **might** rain."
* **Can:** Ability. "I **can** fix this."

## The Preposition Matrix (Spatial/Temporal)

### Time Coordinates

* **AT:** Specific Point. (*At 5:00 PM*)
* **ON:** Specific Day/Date. (*On Monday*)
* **IN:** Enclosed Period. (*In 2025, In July*)

### Space Coordinates

* **AT:** Specific Point. (*At the bus stop*)
* **ON:** Surface. (*On the table*)
* **IN:** Enclosed Volume. (*In the room*)

## The Debugging Protocols (Common Mistakes)

### 1. The "Since vs. For" Error

*Weak Code:* "I am working here since 5 years."
*Strong Code:* "I **have been working** here **for** 5 years."

* *Fix:* Use **Since** for Start Date (2020). Use **For** for Duration (5 years).

### 2. The "Did" Redundancy

*Weak Code:* "Did you went to the store?"
*Strong Code:* "Did you **go** to the store?"

* *Fix:* 'Did' already carries the past tense tag. The main verb stays raw.

### 3. The "Marriage" Preposition

*Weak Code:* "She is married with a doctor."
*Strong Code:* "She is married **to** a doctor."
