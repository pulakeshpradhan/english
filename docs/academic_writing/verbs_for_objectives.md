# Bloom's Taxonomy: Verbs for Objectives

In academic writing, particularly when defining research goals, learning objectives, or technical outcomes, the choice of verbs is critical. **Bloom's Taxonomy** provides a framework for selecting verbs that precisely describe the level of cognitive complexity intended.

## Understanding the Framework

Bloom's Taxonomy categorizes thinking into six levels, ranging from basic recall to complex creation. Using these verbs ensures that your objectives are measurable, clear, and appropriately challenging.

### 1. Remembering (Knowledge)

**Definition:** Recall or retrieve previously learned information. This is the foundation of learning.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Define** | **List** | **Recall** | **Name** |
| **Recognize** | **State** | **Repeat** | **Record** |
| **Label** | **Identify** | **Duplicate** | **Match** |
| **Memorize** | **Order** | **Relate** | **Reproduce** |
| **Outline** | **Quote** | **Tabulate** | **Tell** |

!!! example "Geographical Research Example"
    "**Identify** the major river systems in the Indian subcontinent and **list** their primary tributaries."

### 2. Understanding (Comprehension)

**Definition:** Comprehending the meaning, translation, interpolation, and interpretation of instructions and problems.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Explain** | **Summarize** | **Describe** | **Distinguish** |
| **Indicate** | **Discuss** | **Interpret** | **Classify** |
| **Restate** | **Express** | **Locate** | **Report** |
| **Translate** | **Convert** | **Estimate** | **Paraphrase** |
| **Infer** | **Predict** | **Review** | **Exemplify** |

!!! example "Geographical Research Example"
    "**Explain** the impact of the Himalayan rain shadow effect on the arid climate of the Tibetan Plateau."

### 3. Applying (Application)

**Definition:** Use a concept in a new situation or unprompted use of an abstraction. Applies what was learned into novel situations in the workplace or research.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Apply** | **Choose** | **Show** | **Demonstrate** |
| **Solve** | **Produce** | **Practice** | **Illustrate** |
| **Perform** | **Compute** | **Operate** | **Use** |
| **Schedule** | **Sketch** | **Prepare** | **Modify** |
| **Implement** | **Execute** | **Employ** | **Generalize** |

!!! example "Geographical Research Example"
    "**Use** GIS (Geographic Information Systems) software to **map** land-use changes in Mumbai over the last two decades."

### 4. Analyzing (Analysis)

**Definition:** Separates material or concepts into component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood. Distinguishes between facts and inferences.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analyze** | **Calculate** | **Compare** | **Contrast** |
| **Categorize** | **Examine** | **Model** | **Relate** |
| **Investigate** | **Distinguish** | **Differentiate** | **Appraise** |
| **Test** | **Diagram** | **Inspect** | **Question** |
| **Deconstruct** | **Discriminate** | **Integrate** | **Structure** |

!!! example "Geographical Research Example"
    "**Analyze** the correlation between urban heat island (UHI) intensity and the density of built-up areas in Delhi."

### 5. Evaluating (Evaluation)

**Definition:** Make judgments about the value of ideas or materials based on criteria and standards.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Argue** | **Critique** | **Defend** | **Evaluate** |
| **Justify** | **Support** | **Interpret** | **Assess** |
| **Appraise** | **Rate** | **Revise** | **Score** |
| **Validate** | **Verify** | **Debate** | **Recommend** |
| **Judge** | **Predict** | **Convince** | **Conclude** |

!!! example "Geographical Research Example"
    "**Critique** the effectiveness of current coastal management policies in West Bengal against rising sea levels."

### 6. Creating (Synthesis)

**Definition:** Builds a structure or pattern from diverse elements. Put parts together to form a whole, with emphasis on creating a new meaning or structure.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Synthesize** | **Combine** | **Compose** | **Assemble** |
| **Construct** | **Design** | **Generate** | **Create** |
| **Develop** | **Diagnose** | **Propose** | **Manage** |
| **Hypothesize** | **Plan** | **Formulate** | **Invent** |
| **Devise** | **Originate** | **Reconstruct** | **Systematize** |

!!! example "Geographical Research Example"
    "**Propose** a sustainable urban drainage system (SuDS) model to **mitigate** flash flooding in Bangalore."

## Dos and Don'ts for Writing Objectives

To ensure your research objectives are robust and academically sound, follow these best practices.

### ✅ The Dos

* **Use Active Verbs:** Start your objective with a strong verb from the tables above (e.g., "Analyze," "Evaluate").
* **Be Specific:** Clearly state what you intend to measure or achieve (e.g., "Identify land-use changes" vs. "Look at land").
* **Make it Measurable:** Use verbs that result in a tangible output (e.g., a map, a table, a list, a critical review).
* **Be Concise:** Keep objectives short and focused on a single outcome.
* **Use the SMART Framework:** Ensure objectives are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

### ❌ The Don'ts

* **Avoid Vague Verbs:** Do not use verbs like **"Understand," "Know," "Learn,"** or **"Appreciate."** These are internal mental states and cannot be measured easily.
* **Don't Overcrowd:** Avoid packing multiple unrelated goals into a single objective. Use the **1-S-1-I Protocol** (One Subject, One Idea).
* **Don't Be Too Broad:** Avoid "world-saving" objectives. Keep them localized and manageable for your specific study.
* **Avoid Jargon:** Don't use overly complex language that obscures the actual goal.
* **Don't confuses Tasks with Objectives:** An objective is the *result* (e.g., "Identify causes"), a task is the *process* (e.g., "Conduct a survey"). Focus on the result.

## Why Use Bloom's Verbs?

* **Precision:** They remove ambiguity from your research questions and objectives.
* **Measurability:** It is easier to measure if someone can "calculate" something than if they "know" something.
* **Hierarchy:** They help you ensure your work reaches the higher-level cognitive skills (Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) required for advanced academic writing.
* **Academic Rigor:** Using these verbs demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the cognitive processes involved in your research.
