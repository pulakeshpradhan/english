# Sentence Structure & Grammar

## Structural Frameworks for Sentences

Just as manuscripts have IMRaD, sentences have their own architectural blueprints. Mastering these popular frameworks ensures your individual lines of code (sentences) compile correctly.

### The SVO Model (Subject-Verb-Object)

English is an **SVO** language. The strongest sentences follow this order straight line.

* **Framework:** `Actor (Subject)` + `Action (Verb)` + `Recipient (Object)`
* *Weak (Passive):* The experiment was conducted by the research team. (O-V-S)
* *Strong (SVO):* The research team conducted the experiment. (S-V-O)
* **Rule:** Keep the Subject and Verb close together. Do not let a long clause separate the actor from the action.
* **Strategic Use of Voice:** While active voice is preferred, passive voice has its place in academic writing.
  * **Use Active Voice in:** Introduction, Results (to show researcher action), and Discussion (to show researcher interpretation).
  * **Use Passive Voice in:** Methods (to focus on the objects and processes, not the people).
  * *Example (Methods):* "The sample **was heated** to 100°C" (Passive - Focus on sample).
  * *Example (Discussion):* "We **suggest** that this increase..." (Active - Focus on researcher interpretation).

!!! tip "When to Use Passive Voice"
    Passive voice is acceptable when:
    1. The actor is unknown or irrelevant ("The samples **were collected** in 2020")
    2. You want to emphasize the action or recipient ("The data **were analyzed** using SPSS")
    3. In Methods sections to maintain objectivity

### Nominalization: The "Zombie Noun" Pitfall

Nominalization is the process of turning a strong verb into a weak, heavy noun. This "Zombification" makes sentences longer and harder to understand.

* *Verb (Strong):* "We **analyzed** the data."
* *Nominalized (Weak):* "An **analysis** of the data was performed."
* **Why it's bad:** It hides the action and adds unnecessary words like "was performed" or "is carried out."
* **The Fix:** Find the noun ending in *-tion, -ment, -ance, or -ing* and turn it back into its original verb form.

#### Common Nominalization Fixes

| Nominalized (Weak) | De-nominalized (Strong) |
| :--- | :--- |
| The implementation of the policy | The committee implemented the policy |
| Conduct an investigation | Investigate |
| Make an assumption | Assume |
| Provide an explanation | Explain |
| Give consideration to | Consider |
| Reach a conclusion | Conclude |
| Make a decision | Decide |
| The occurrence of flooding | Flooding occurred |
| The collection of data | We collected data |

### The Known-New Contract

Based on Gopen and Swan's *Science of Scientific Writing*, this principle governs how sentences link together to create flow.

* **The Setup:** Readers naturally expect a sentence to start with information they already know (Context) and end with new information (Emphasis).
* **Structure:** `[Known Info / Context] → [Verbs] → [New Info / Stress]`
* *Bad Flow:* "New results (New) were found by applying the model (Known)." → *Reader feels bewildered.*
* *Good Flow:* "By applying the model (Known), we found new results (New)." → *Reader feels guided.*

!!! example "Practical Application"
    **Sentence 1:** "Urban sprawl has increased significantly in Delhi over the past decade."

    **Sentence 2 (Good flow):** "This **increase** has led to deforestation."
    
    **Sentence 2 (Bad flow):** "Deforestation has been caused by this **increase**."
    
    The word "increase" from Sentence 1 becomes the "known" information linking to Sentence 2.

### The Paramedic Method (Lanham)

A popular 6-step algorithm for identifying and killing "dead" bureaucratic phrasing to revive clarity.

1. Circle the **Prepositions** (of, in, about, for, onto, into).
2. Circle the **"Is" forms** (is, was, are, were, be).
3. Ask: "Where is the **Action**?" (Change the "Zombie Noun" back into a Verb).
4. Ask: "Who is the **Actor**?" (Put the Doer before the Verb).
5. Eliminate the unnecessary prepositions.
6. *Result:* "The implementation of the policy was done by the committee" (10 words) → "The committee implemented the policy" (5 words).

**Example Application:**

Original (23 words):
> "The determination of the impact of temperature on the growth of plants was carried out by the research team."

**Step 1:** Circle prepositions: *of, of, on, of, by*
**Step 2:** Circle "is" forms: *was*
**Step 3:** Find action: "determination" → determine; "growth" → grow
**Step 4:** Who is actor? The research team
**Step 5:** Eliminate prepositions
**Result (10 words):**
> "The research team determined how temperature affects plant growth."

## Mastering Sentence Structure

A "run-on sentence" is one of the most common mistakes in academic writing. It occurs when a sentence is too long, containing too many ideas or subjects without proper punctuation.

### Run-On Sentences

**Examples:**

* *"I went to the beach yesterday, it was hot."*
* *"She likes playing soccer she usually plays on Saturday morning."*

Run-on sentences make ideas difficult to follow. Readers tire quickly when sentences meander.

**The Golden Rule:**
> "A sentence has one subject and one main idea."

**Analysis:**

*"I went to the beach yesterday, it was hot."*
This sentence has two subjects ("I" and "it") and two distinct ideas (going to the beach, and the weather). By the rules of grammar, this must be separated.

*Note:* Even if the subject refers to the same person (e.g., "Susan" and "she"), using the pronoun "she" creates a grammatical new subject, often requiring a new sentence or clause.

### Comma Splices

A **comma splice** is a specific type of run-on sentence where two independent clauses are joined *only* by a comma.

* *Incorrect:* "I bought milk, it was expensive."
* *Correction:* You cannot use a comma just because the ideas are closely related. If there is a new subject, you generally need a new sentence or a stronger punctuation mark.

**More Examples:**

| Comma Splice (Wrong) | Corrected Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| The data was collected in May, it was analyzed in June. | The data was collected in May**. It** was analyzed in June. |
| The model failed, we revised it. | The model failed**; therefore,** we revised it. |
| Participants were screened, only 50 qualified. | Participants were screened**, and** only 50 qualified. |

## Solutions to Run-On Sentences

There are three ways to fix a run-on sentence:

**1. Use a Period**
Break the thought into two distinct sentences.

* *Bad:* Hank loves baseball and he plays every Sunday.
* *Good:* Hank loves baseball. He plays every Sunday.

**2. Use a Semicolon (;) and a Transitional Word**
Connect related independent clauses with a semicolon.

* *Good:* Hank loves baseball; therefore, he plays every Sunday.
* *Good:* The hypothesis was confirmed; however, further testing is needed.

**3. Use a Comma with a Coordinating Conjunction ("FANBOYS")**
Use a comma followed by "for", "and", "nor", "but", "or", "yet", or "so".

* *Good:* Hank loves baseball, so he plays every day.
* *Good:* Hank loves baseball, but he never plays professionally.

!!! note "FANBOYS Mnemonic"
    **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o

    Only these seven conjunctions can join two independent clauses with just a comma!

## Advanced Grammar Rules

Beyond sentence length, accuracy in structure creates a polished, professional impression.

### Subject-Verb Agreement

The verb must always agree with the subject in number, even if the subject is complex or far away.

* **Rule:** Ignore the prepositional phrase between subject and verb.
  * *Incorrect:* "The list of items **are** on the desk." ("Items" is plural, but "List" is singular).
  * *Correct:* "The **list** of items **is** on the desk." (List → is).
* **Collective Nouns:** Groups (team, committee, family) usually take a singular verb.
  * *Correct:* "The **team is** winning."
  * *Correct:* "The **data show**..." (Note: "data" is plural of "datum")

#### Tricky Subject-Verb Agreement Cases

| Sentence | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Each of the participants **was** tested. | "Each" is singular, ignore "participants" |
| The number of errors **has** decreased. | "The number" is singular |
| A number of errors **have** been found. | "A number" is plural |
| Neither the students nor the teacher **was** present. | Verb agrees with nearest subject |
| The data **show** a significant trend. | "Data" is plural |

### Parallel Structure

When listing items, comparing concepts, or using conjunctions, keep the grammatical form consistent.

* *Incorrect:* "The methodology involved **surveying** participants, **data analysis**, and **to write** the report." (Gerund, Noun, Infinitive).
* *Correct:* "The methodology involved **surveying** participants, **analyzing** data, and **writing** the report." (Gerund, Gerund, Gerund).

#### More Parallel Structure Examples

| Non-Parallel (Wrong) | Parallel (Correct) |
| :--- | :--- |
| The goals are to reduce waste, increasing efficiency, and cost management. | The goals are to **reduce** waste, **increase** efficiency, and **manage** costs. |
| She is intelligent, creative, and works hard. | She is intelligent, creative, and **hard-working**. |
| The study examined temperature, pressure, and how humidity affects growth. | The study examined **temperature, pressure, and humidity** effects on growth. |

### Dangling Modifiers

Check for "dangling modifiers"—phrases that modify the wrong subject, often occurring in passive voice.

* *Incorrect:* "**After reviewing the data**, the results seemed inconclusive." (Who reviewed the data? The results didn't review themselves).
* *Correct:* "**After we reviewed the data**, the results seemed inconclusive."

#### Common Dangling Modifier Patterns

| Dangling (Wrong) | Corrected |
| :--- | :--- |
| Walking to the lab, the samples were forgotten. | Walking to the lab, **I** forgot the samples. |
| To improve accuracy, the calibration was adjusted. | To improve accuracy, **we** adjusted the calibration. |
| Having analyzed the data, the conclusion was obvious. | Having analyzed the data, **we found** the conclusion obvious. |

### Pronoun Agreement and Clarity

Ensure pronouns (it, they, this) clearly refer to a specific noun (the antecedent).

* *Vague:* "The temperature rose while the pressure dropped, and **this** caused the failure." (What caused the failure? The rise? The drop? Or the combination?)
* *Clear:* "The temperature rose while the pressure dropped, and **this thermal fluctuation** caused the failure."

#### Pronoun Reference Issues

| Vague (Wrong) | Clear (Correct) |
| :--- | :--- |
| The researchers studied bacteria. They were diverse. | The researchers studied bacteria. **The bacteria** were diverse. |
| In the paper, it says... | The paper states... (Or: **The authors state**...) |
| This shows that... | **This finding** shows that... |

### Misplaced Modifiers

Place modifiers (adjectives, adverbs, phrases) as close as possible to the word they modify.

* *Misplaced:* "We almost tested all the samples." (Almost tested? Or tested almost all?)
* *Clear:* "We tested almost all the samples."

**More Examples:**

| Misplaced | Corrected |
| :--- | :--- |
| The study only examined three variables. | The study examined **only** three variables. |
| She nearly earned $10,000 from the grant. | She earned **nearly** $10,000 from the grant. |

## Academic Punctuation Protocols

Punctuation isn't just about grammar; it's about controlling the "logic flow" of your sentence.

### The Semicolon (;) - The Soft Link

* **Protocol:** Use it to connect two independent clauses that are closely related in meaning but can stand alone.
* *Example:* "The model is robust; it remained stable under high noise conditions."
* *Example:* "Temperature increased by 15°C; humidity decreased proportionally."

### The Colon (:) - The Hard Pointer

* **Protocol:** Use it to introduce a list or a concluding explanation that is directly linked to the preceding clause.
* *Example:* "The study focused on three variables: temperature, pressure, and humidity."
* *Example:* "The result was clear: the hypothesis was rejected."
* *Example:* "The findings suggest one conclusion: urban sprawl accelerates deforestation."

### The Em-dash (—) - The Academic Emphasis

* **Protocol:** Use it to set off parenthetical information that you want to emphasize or to mark a sharp break in thought. Use sparingly (no more than once per paragraph).
* *Example:* "The participants—all of whom were over 65—showed significant improvement."
* *Warning:* Do not confuse it with a hyphen (-), which is used for joining words (e.g., "high-impact").
* *Example:* "Three districts—Pune, Mumbai, and Nagpur—were selected for analysis."

### Parentheses vs. Commas vs. Dashes

All three can set off parenthetical information, but they carry different emphasis levels:

| Punctuation | Emphasis Level | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parentheses ( )** | Least emphasis (de-emphasize) | The samples (n=50) were analyzed. |
| **Commas , ,** | Neutral emphasis | The samples, which numbered 50, were analyzed. |
| **Em-dashes — —** | Strong emphasis | The samples—all carefully selected—were analyzed. |

### The Apostrophe (')

**Possessive Forms:**
* Singular noun: researcher's data
* Plural noun ending in s: researchers' findings
* Plural noun not ending in s: children's responses
* Compound nouns: mother-in-law's opinion

**Common Errors:**
* ❌ It's findings (Wrong: "it's" = "it is")
* ✅ Its findings (Correct: possessive)
* ❌ The 1990's (Wrong for decades)
* ✅ The 1990s (Correct)

## Common Grammar Traps in Academic Writing

### 1. "Data is" vs. "Data are"

* **Rule:** "Data" is the plural of "datum." Use plural verbs.
* *Correct:* "The data **show** a clear trend."
* *Incorrect:* "The data **shows** a clear trend."
* *Exception:* In informal contexts, singular usage is increasingly accepted, but academic writing should maintain the plural.

### 2. "Between" vs. "Among"

* **Between:** Use for two items or distinct items.
  * "The difference **between** urban and rural areas..."
* **Among:** Use for three or more indefinite items.
  * "The variation **among** the samples..."

### 3. "Less" vs. "Fewer"

* **Less:** For uncountable nouns (less water, less time)
* **Fewer:** For countable nouns (fewer samples, fewer participants)
* *Correct:* "Fewer than 100 participants..."
* *Incorrect:* "Less than 100 participants..."

### 4. "Which" vs. "That"

* **That:** Restrictive clause (essential to meaning, no commas)
  * "The samples **that** were contaminated were discarded."
* **Which:** Non-restrictive clause (additional info, use commas)
  * "The samples, **which** were collected in May, were analyzed."

### 5. "Effect" vs. "Affect"

* **Affect:** Verb meaning "to influence"
  * "Temperature **affects** growth rate."
* **Effect:** Noun meaning "result" or "consequence"
  * "The **effect** of temperature on growth..."
* *Exception:* "Effect" can be a verb meaning "to bring about" (rare in scientific writing)

## Sentence Variety for Readability

While maintaining academic formality, vary your sentence structure to avoid monotony.

### Sentence Length Variation

| Pattern | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Short (Impact)** | The results were clear. |
| **Medium (Standard)** | The analysis revealed a significant correlation between temperature and yield. |
| **Long (Complex)** | Although the sample size was limited, the findings, which were corroborated by two independent reviewers, suggested a strong relationship between urban density and air quality degradation. |

**Best Practice:** Alternate between sentence lengths. Follow a long, complex sentence with a shorter one for emphasis.

### Sentence Opening Variation

Don't always start with the subject. Vary your openings:

1. **Transitional word:** "However, the results differed..."
2. **Prepositional phrase:** "In the analysis, we found..."
3. **Participial phrase:** "Having examined the data, we concluded..."
4. **Dependent clause:** "Although the model was robust, it failed..."
5. **Subject-verb:** "The study examined..." (Standard)

!!! tip "Readability Test"
    After writing a paragraph, read it aloud. If it sounds monotonous or choppy, revise for sentence variety.
