# Grammar Tips & Common Mistakes

This guide covers the most common grammar challenges in English academic writing, organized by topic with clear examples and practice guidance.

---

## Subject-Verb Agreement

### Basic Rules

The verb must agree with the subject in number (singular or plural).

| Rule | Example | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Singular subject → Singular verb** | The researcher **analyzes** the data. | "Researcher" (singular) → "analyzes" (singular) |
| **Plural subject → Plural verb** | The researchers **analyze** the data. | "Researchers" (plural) → "analyze" (plural) |
| **Collective nouns (usually singular)** | The team **is** ready. | Group acts as one unit |
| **"Data" is plural** | The data **show** a trend. | "Datum" (singular) → "Data" (plural) |

#### Am, Is, Are (Present)

| Subject | Verb | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I | am | I **am** conducting research. |
| He/She/It | is | The sample **is** contaminated. |
| We/You/They | are | The results **are** significant. |

#### Was, Were (Past)

| Subject | Verb | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| I/He/She/It | was | The temperature **was** recorded hourly. |
| We/You/They | were | Participants **were** selected randomly. |

### Prepositional Phrases & Relative Clauses

**Key Rule:** The verb agrees with the main subject, NOT with words in prepositional phrases or relative clauses.

#### Prepositional Phrases

| Example | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- |
| The list **of participants** is complete. | Subject: "list" (singular) → verb: "is" |
| The results **from the survey** were analyzed. | Subject: "results" (plural) → verb: "were" |
| One **of the samples** was contaminated. | Subject: "one" (singular) → verb: "was" |

!!! warning "Common Mistake"
    ❌ Wrong: "The collection of samples **were** analyzed."

    ✅ Correct: "The collection of samples **was** analyzed." (Subject: collection)

#### Relative Clauses

| Example | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| The model **that predicts floods** is accurate. | Subject: "model" (singular) → "is" |
| The models **that predict floods** are accurate. | Subject: "models" (plural) → "are" |
| Researchers **who study climate** often use satellites. | Subject: "researchers" (plural) → "use" |

## Modal Verbs in Detail

### CAN vs. COULD

| Modal | Use | Academic Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CAN** | Present ability; strong possibility | "GIS **can** detect land-use changes accurately." |
| **COULD** | Past ability; hypothetical; polite request | "With additional funding, we **could** expand the study area." |

**Differences:**

- **Can** = Present/Future: "This method **can** reduce errors."
- **Could** = Past: "Historical data **could** not provide sufficient detail."
- **Could** = Hypothesis: "Better models **could** improve predictions."

### WILL vs. WOULD

| Modal | Use | Academic Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WILL** | Future certainty; prediction | "The findings **will** be published in March." |
| **WOULD** | Hypothetical; conditional; past habit | "Higher temperatures **would** accelerate melting." |

**Key Differences:**

- **Will** (factual future): "We **will** collect samples weekly."
- **Would** (hypothetical): "We **would** collect samples weekly if funding permitted."
- **Would** (polite): "We **would** suggest that further research is needed."

### WILL vs. SHALL

| Modal | Use | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WILL** | General future; standard usage | "The study **will** examine three variables." |
| **SHALL** | Formal future (rare); legal obligations | "Participants **shall** be informed of risks." (formal/legal) |

!!! tip "Modern Usage"
    "Shall" is rarely used in modern academic writing except in legal or very formal contexts. Use "will" for standard future tense.

### COULD vs. WOULD

| Scenario | Could | Would |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hypothetical possibility** | "This **could** work with modifications." | "This **would** work if we had more data." |
| **Past ability** | "We **could** see the pattern clearly." | "We **would** see the pattern every time." (habitual) |
| **Polite request** | "**Could** you review the draft?" | "**Would** you review the draft?" |

### MAY vs. MIGHT

Both express possibility, but with different levels of certainty.

| Modal | Certainty | Academic Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MAY** | Moderate possibility (40-60%) | "Climate change **may** affect monsoon patterns." |
| **MIGHT** | Lower possibility (20-40%) | "The anomaly **might** be due to measurement error." |

**For Past Possibility:**

- **May have**: "The error **may have** occurred during data collection."
- **Might have**: "The participants **might have** misunderstood the instructions."

### SHOULD HAVE, COULD HAVE, WOULD HAVE (Past Modals)

These express regret, missed opportunities, or hypothetical past situations.

| Modal | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Should have** | Past advice; regret | "We **should have** collected more samples." (but didn't) |
| **Could have** | Past possibility | "The results **could have been** different with larger sample sizes." |
| **Would have** | Hypothetical past | "The model **would have** predicted the flood if provided with adequate data." |

!!! example "Academic Writing"
    - "The study **should have** included control groups to strengthen validity."
    - "With better instruments, we **could have** detected smaller variations."
    - "Had we known about the policy change, we **would have** modified the methodology."

## Perfect Tenses

### HAVE / HAS / HAD

| Tense | Structure | When to Use | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Present Perfect** | have/has + past participle | Past action with present relevance | "Researchers **have studied** this phenomenon for decades." |
| **Past Simple** | had + past participle | Completed past action | "We **studied** the samples last year." |
| **Past Perfect** | had + past participle | Past action before another past action | "We analyzed samples that **had been collected** in 2019." |

**Key Differences:**

- **Have/Has** (Present Perfect): Links past to present
  - "Studies **have shown** that temperatures are rising." (ongoing relevance)
  
- **Had** (Past Perfect): One past event before another
  - "By 2020, temperatures **had risen** by 2°C." (rise completed before 2020)

### HAVE BEEN / HAS BEEN / HAD BEEN

These forms create perfect continuous tenses, emphasizing duration.

| Form | Structure | Example | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Have been** | have been + -ing | "We **have been monitoring** air quality since 2010." | Action from past continuing to present |
| **Has been** | has been + -ing | "The glacier **has been retreating** for 20 years." | Singular subject, ongoing action |
| **Had been** | had been + -ing | "We **had been collecting** data for 5 years when the funding ended." | Past continuous action stopped by another past event |

**Comparison:**

| Present Perfect | Present Perfect Continuous |
| :--- | :--- |
| "We **have collected** 500 samples." (emphasis on result) | "We **have been collecting** samples for 6 months." (emphasis on duration) |

### HAVE HAD / HAS HAD / HAD HAD

Yes, these are correct! They use "have" as an auxiliary and "had" as the main verb (meaning "possessed" or "experienced").

| Construction | Example | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Have had** | "We **have had** difficulties with the equipment." | Present perfect of "have" = We experienced difficulties (past to present) |
| **Has had** | "The region **has had** three floods this year." | Singular subject |
| **Had had** | "By 2020, the region **had had** five major floods." | Past perfect = floods occurred before 2020 |

**More Examples:**

- "Researchers **have had** access to the database since 2015."
- "The study **has had** significant impact on policy."
- "Before the intervention, participants **had had** limited healthcare access."

## Passive Voice

### When to Use Passive Voice

Passive voice is appropriate in specific academic contexts:

| Context | Active | Passive | Why Passive? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Methods (focus on process)** | "We heated the samples to 100°C." | "The samples **were heated** to 100°C." | Emphasize the process, not who did it |
| **Actor unknown** | — | "The data **were collected** in 2019." | We don't know or care who collected |
| **Results (stating facts)** | "We observed significant changes." | "Significant changes **were observed**." | Focus on the finding |

### How to Use BEING

"Being" has three main uses in academic writing:

#### 1. Being = Passive Voice (Present Continuous)

| Active | Passive with BEING |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Researchers are examining the data." | "The data **is being examined**." |
| "We are monitoring air quality." | "Air quality **is being monitored**." |

#### 2. Being = Gerund (Noun)

"Being" as a noun means "the state of existing."

- "**Being** accurate is essential in research."
- "The issue of samples **being** contaminated was addressed."

#### 3. Being = Participle Clause

Replaces "because" or "since" in formal writing.

- "**Being** a coastal city, Mumbai is vulnerable to cyclones." (= Because it is a coastal city)
- "**Being** limited by funding, we reduced the sample size." (= Since we were limited)

!!! warning "Avoid Overusing BEING"
    In many cases, simpler alternatives are clearer:

    ❌ Wordy: "The samples **being** analyzed showed contamination."
    
    ✅ Better: "The samples **analyzed** showed contamination."

## Sentence Structure

### Simple, Compound, Complex Sentences

| Type | Structure | Example | Use in Academic Writing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple** | One independent clause | "The data show a clear trend." | Stating facts directly |
| **Compound** | Two independent clauses joined by conjunction | "The model was accurate, **but** it required extensive data." | Connecting equal ideas |
| **Complex** | Independent clause + dependent clause | "**Although** the sample was small, the results were significant." | Showing relationships (cause, contrast, condition) |

**Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS):**

- **F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, **S**o

**Subordinating Conjunctions:**

- **Cause:** because, since, as
- **Contrast:** although, though, while, whereas
- **Condition:** if, unless, provided that
- **Time:** when, while, before, after, until

!!! example "Academic Writing Mix"
    Use a variety of sentence types:

    - **Simple:** "Urban sprawl increased significantly."
    - **Compound:** "Urban sprawl increased significantly, **and** deforestation rates rose proportionally."
    - **Complex:** "**Because** urban sprawl increased significantly, deforestation rates rose."

## Conditionals

### Zero, First, Second, Third Conditionals

| Type | Structure | Use | Academic Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zero** | If + present, present | General truths | "If temperature exceeds 100°C, water **boils**." |
| **First** | If + present, will + base | Real future possibility | "If funding **is** approved, we **will expand** the study." |
| **Second** | If + past, would + base | Hypothetical present/future | "If we **had** more time, we **would** include more variables." |
| **Third** | If + past perfect, would have + past participle | Hypothetical past | "If we **had collected** more data, results **would have been** more robust." |

### Mixed Conditionals

Combines different time frames.

**Past condition → Present result:**

- "If urban planning policies **had been** implemented earlier, the city **would be** less congested today."

**Present condition → Past result:**

- "If the model **were** more accurate, it **would have predicted** the flood."
