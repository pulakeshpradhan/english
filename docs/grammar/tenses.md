# English Tenses

Understanding English tenses allows you to express when actions happen.

## The 12 Tenses

English has three main time frames: **Past**, **Present**, and **Future**. Each has four aspects: **Simple**, **Continuous**, **Perfect**, and **Perfect Continuous**.

| Aspect | Past | Present | Future |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple** | I walked | I walk | I will walk |
| **Continuous** | I was walking | I am walking | I will be walking |
| **Perfect** | I had walked | I have walked | I will have walked |
| **Perfect Continuous** | I had been walking | I have been walking | I will have been walking |
