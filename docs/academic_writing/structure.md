# Sentence Structure & Grammar

## Structural Frameworks for Sentences

Just as manuscripts have IMRaD, sentences have their own architectural blueprints. Mastering these popular frameworks ensures your individual lines of code (sentences) compile correctly.

### The SVO Model (Subject-Verb-Object)

English is an **SVO** language. The strongest sentences follow this order straight line.

* **Framework:** `Actor (Subject)` + `Action (Verb)` + `Recipient (Object)`
* *Weak (Passive):* The experiment was conducted by the research team. (O-V-S)
* *Strong (SVO):* The research team conducted the experiment. (S-V-O)
* **Rule:** Keep the Subject and Verb close together. Do not let a long clause separate the actor from the action.
* **Strategic Use of Voice:** While active voice is preferred, passive voice has its place in academic writing.
  * **Use Active Voice in:** Introduction, Results (to show researcher action), and Discussion (to show researcher interpretation).
  * **Use Passive Voice in:** Methods (to focus on the objects and processes, not the people).
  * *Example (Methods):* "The sample **was heated** to 100°C" (Passive - Focus on sample).
  * *Example (Discussion):* "We **suggest** that this increase..." (Active - Focus on researcher interpretation).

### Nominalization: The "Zombie Noun" Pitfall

Nominalization is the process of turning a strong verb into a weak, heavy noun. This "Zombification" makes sentences longer and harder to understand.

* *Verb (Strong):* "We **analyzed** the data."
* *Nominalized (Weak):* "An **analysis** of the data was performed."
* **Why it's bad:** It hides the action and adds unnecessary words like "was performed" or "is carried out."
* **The Fix:** Find the noun ending in *-tion, -ment, -ance, or -ing* and turn it back into its original verb form.

### The Known-New Contract

Based on Gopen and Swan's *Science of Scientific Writing*, this principle governs how sentences link together to create flow.

* **The Setup:** readers naturally expect a sentence to start with information they already know (Context) and end with new information (Emphasis).
* **Structure:** `[Known Info / Context] -> [Verbs] -> [New Info / Stress]`
* *Bad Flow:* "New results (New) were found by applying the model (Known)." -> *Reader feels bewildered.*
* *Good Flow:* "By applying the model (Known), we found new results (New)." -> *Reader feels guided.*

### The Paramedic Method (Lanham)

A popular 6-step algorithm for identifying and killing "dead" bureaucratic phrasing to revive clarity.

1. Circle the **Prepositions** (of, in, about, for, onto, into).
2. Circle the **"Is" forms** (is, was, are, were, be).
3. Ask: "Where is the **Action**?" (Change the "Zombie Noun" back into a Verb).
4. Ask: "Who is the **Actor**?" (Put the Doer before the Verb).
5. Eliminate the unnecessary prepositions.
6. *Result:* "The implementation of the policy was done by the committee" (10 words) -> "The committee implemented the policy" (5 words).

## Mastering Sentence Structure

A "run-on sentence" is one of the most common mistakes in academic writing. It occurs when a sentence is too long, containing too many ideas or subjects without proper punctuation.

### Run-On Sentences

**Examples:**

* *"I went to the beach yesterday, it was hot."*
* *"She likes playing soccer she usually plays on Saturday morning."*

Run-on sentences make ideas difficult to follow. Readers tire quickly when sentences meander.

**The Golden Rule:**
> "A sentence has one subject and one main idea."

**Analysis:**

*"I went to the beach yesterday, it was hot."*
This sentence has two subjects ("I" and "it") and two distinct ideas (going to the beach, and the weather). By the rules of grammar, this must be separated.

*Note:* Even if the subject refers to the same person (e.g., "Susan" and "she"), using the pronoun "she" creates a grammatical new subject, often requiring a new sentence or clause.

### Comma Splices

A **comma splice** is a specific type of run-on sentence where two independent clauses are joined *only* by a comma.

* *Incorrect:* "I bought milk, it was expensive."
* *Correction:* You cannot use a comma just because the ideas are closely related. If there is a new subject, you generally need a new sentence or a stronger punctuation mark.

## Solutions to Run-On Sentences

There are three ways to fix a run-on sentence:

**1. Use a Period**
Break the thought into two distinct sentences.

* *Bad:* Hank loves baseball and he plays every Sunday.
* *Good:* Hank loves baseball. He plays every Sunday.

**2. Use a Semicolon (;) and a Transitional Word**
Connect related independent clauses with a semicolon.

* *Good:* Hank loves baseball; therefore, he plays every Sunday.

**3. Use a Comma with a Coordinating Conjunction ("FANBOYS")**
Use a comma followed by "for", "and", "nor", "but", "or", "yet", or "so".

* *Good:* Hank loves baseball, so he plays every day.
* *Good:* Hank loves baseball, but he never plays.

## Advanced Grammar Rules

Beyond sentence length, accuracy in structure creates a polished, professional impression.

### Subject-Verb Agreement

The verb must always agree with the subject in number, even if the subject is complex or far away.

* **Rule:** Ignore the prepositional phrase between subject and verb.
  * *Incorrect:* "The list of items **are** on the desk." ("Items" is plural, but "List" is singular).
  * *Correct:* "The **list** of items **is** on the desk." (List -> is).
* **Collective Nouns:** Groups (team, committee, family) usually take a singular verb.
  * *Correct:* "The **team is** winning."

### Parallel Structure

When listing items, comparing concepts, or using conjunctions, keep the grammatical form consistent.

* *Incorrect:* "The methodology involved **surveying** participants, **data analysis**, and **to write** the report." (Gerund, Noun, Infinitive).
* *Correct:* "The methodology involved **surveying** participants, **analyzing** data, and **writing** the report." (Gerund, Gerund, Gerund).

### Dangling Implementation

Check for "dangling modifiers"—phrases that modify the wrong subject, often occurring in passive voice.

* *Incorrect:* "**After reviewing the data**, the results seemed inconclusive." (Who reviewed the data? The results didn't review themselves).
* *Correct:* "**After we reviewed the data**, the results seemed inconclusive."

### Pronoun Implementation

Ensure pronouns (it, they, this) clearly refer to a specific noun (the antecedent).

* *Vague:* "The temperature rose while the pressure dropped, and **this** caused the failure." (What caused the failure? The rise? The drop? Or the combination?)
* *Clear:* "The temperature rose while the pressure dropped, and **this thermal fluctuation** caused the failure."

## Academic Punctuation Protocols

Punctuation isn't just about grammar; it's about controlling the "logic flow" of your sentence.

### The Semicolon (;) - The Soft Link

* **Protocol:** Use it to connect two independent clauses that are closely related in meaning but can stand alone.
* *Example:* "The model is robust; it remained stable under high noise conditions."

### The Colon (:) - The Hard Pointer

* **Protocol:** Use it to introduce a list or a concluding explanation that is directly linked to the preceding clause.
* *Example:* "The study focused on three variables: temperature, pressure, and humidity."
* *Example:* "The result was clear: the hypothesis was rejected."

### The Em-dash (—) - The Academic Emphasis

* **Protocol:** Use it to set off parenthetical information that you want to emphasize or to mark a sharp break in thought. Use sparingly (no more than once per paragraph).
* *Example:* "The participants—all of whom were over 65—showed significant improvement."
* *Warning:* Do not confuse it with a hyphen (-), which is used for joining words (e.g., "high-impact").
