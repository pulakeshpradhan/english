# Articles: a, an, the

Articles are tiny but tricky. They indicate whether a noun is specific or general.

## The Three Articles

### 1. The (Definite Article)

Used for specific nouns, or when the listener knows which noun you mean.

- *The* dog barked. (A specific dog)
- *The* sun is bright. (The only one)

### 2. A / An (Indefinite Articles)

Used for non-specific, countable nouns.

- I saw *a* dog. (Any dog)
- I want *an* apple. (Any apple)

**Use 'A' before consonant sounds.**
**Use 'An' before vowel sounds.**
