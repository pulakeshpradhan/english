# Pronunciation Lessons

Specific lessons targeting difficult sounds, silent letters, and stress patterns from the [Pronunciation Lessons Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzVm1SmjPKc_OnC56Bb5G2jhqDA_UNAOZ).

## Core Challenges

### 1. Silent Letters

- **Know**, **Comb**, **Knife**, **Debt**
- There are rules, but also many exceptions.

### 2. Word Stress

English is a stress-timed language. Emphasizing the *wrong* syllable changes the word.

- **REC**ord (noun) vs. Re**CORD** (verb).

### 3. Vowel Sounds

- **Ship** (short i) vs. **Sheep** (long ee).
- **Pen** (short e) vs. **Pan** (short a).
