# How to Become Fluent

Steps to improve your English fluency from the "How to Become Fluent" playlist.

## Core Strategies

1. **Think in English**: The holy grail of fluency. Start with simple Nouns, then Verbs, then Phrases.
2. **Immerse Yourself**: Surround yourself with English content (movies, music, podcasts).
3. **Practice Speaking Daily**: Even if it's just to yourself.
4. **Accept Your Accent**: Be proud of your unique voice; focus on clarity, not sounding exactly like a native.
5. **Use It or Lose It**: If you don't practice, your progress will stall.
6. **Find a Partner**: Use apps or local meetups to find speaking partners.
