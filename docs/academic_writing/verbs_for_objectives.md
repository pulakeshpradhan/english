# Bloom's Taxonomy: Verbs for Objectives

In academic writing, particularly when defining research goals, learning objectives, or technical outcomes, the choice of verbs is critical. **Bloom's Taxonomy** provides a framework for selecting verbs that precisely describe the level of cognitive complexity intended.

## Understanding the Framework

Bloom's Taxonomy categorizes thinking into six levels, ranging from basic recall to complex creation. Using these verbs ensures that your objectives are measurable, clear, and appropriately challenging.

### 1. Remembering (Knowledge)

**Definition:** Recall or retrieve previously learned information.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Define | List | Recall | Name |
| Recognize | State | Repeat | Record |
| Label | Arrange | Duplicate | Match |
| Memorize | Order | Relate | Reproduce |
| Outline | Name | Arrange | Define |

**Usage Example:** "By the end of this chapter, the reader will be able to **define** the core principles of thermodynamics."

### 2. Understanding (Comprehension)

**Definition:** Comprehending the meaning, translation, interpolation, and interpretation of instructions and problems.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Explain | Summarize | Describe | Distinguish |
| Indicate | Discuss | Recognize | Classify |
| Restate | Express | Locate | Report |
| Tell | Convert | Estimate | Select |
| Infer | Predict | Translate | Review |

**Usage Example:** "The student should be able to **summarize** the main arguments presented in the research paper."

### 3. Applying (Application)

**Definition:** Use a concept in a new situation or unprompted use of an abstraction. Applies what was learned in the classroom into novel situations in the work place.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Apply | Choose | Show | Demonstrate |
| Solve | Produce | Practice | Illustrate |
| Perform | Compute | Operate | Use |
| Schedule | Sketch | Prepare | Modify |
| Predict | Extrapolate | Manage | Change |

**Usage Example:** "Apply the statistical model to **solve** the problem of variable correlation in high-density datasets."

### 4. Analyzing (Analysis)

**Definition:** Separates material or concepts into component parts so that its organizational structure may be understood. Distinguishes between facts and inferences.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Analyze | Calculate | Compare | Contrast |
| Categorize | Examine | Model | Relate |
| Investigate | Distinguish | Differentiate | Appraise |
| Test | Diagram | Inspect | Question |
| Classify | Deduce | Separate | Divide |

**Usage Example:** "The researcher will **analyze** the dataset to identify significant outliers and trends."

### 5. Evaluating (Evaluation)

**Definition:** Make judgments about the value of ideas or materials.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Argue | Critique | Defend | Evaluate |
| Justify | Support | Interpretation | Assess |
| Appraise | Rate | Revise | Score |
| Select | Choose | Estimate | Measure |
| Judge | Predict | Convince | Conclude |

**Usage Example:** "Critically **evaluate** the effectiveness of the proposed policy in mitigating environmental impacts."

### 6. Creating (Synthesis)

**Definition:** Builds a structure or pattern from diverse elements. Put parts together to form a whole, with emphasis on creating a new meaning or structure.

| Verbs | | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Synthesize | Combine | Compose | Assemble |
| Construct | Design | Generate | Create |
| Develop | Diagnose | Propose | Manage |
| Hypothesize | Plan | Formulate | Invent |
| Set up | Write | Arrange | Collect |

**Usage Example:** "Based on the findings, the author will **propose** a new framework for sustainable urban development."

## Why Use Bloom's Verbs?

- **Precision:** They remove ambiguity from your research questions and objectives.
- **Measurability:** It is easier to measure if someone can "calculate" something than if they "know" something.
- **Hierarchy:** They help you ensure your work reaches the higher-level cognitive skills (Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating) required for advanced academic writing.
