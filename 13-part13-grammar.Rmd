# The GRAMMAR Codes

## 1-S-1-I Protocol (Structure) {-}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=pBlue!10, colframe=pBlue, title=\textbf{The Universal Rule}]
\textbf{1-S-1-I:} A sentence must have \textbf{1 Subject} and \textbf{1 Idea}.
\end{tcolorbox}

### The Problem: "Subject Overload"
A run-on sentence happens when you pack two subjects/ideas into one space without a divider.

> \textit{Bad Code:} "I went to the beach yesterday, it was hot."
>
> \textbf{Error:} Two subjects (**I** and **It**) = Two sentences needed.

### The Trap: "The Comma Splice"
Never gluewe two independent ideas with just a distinct comma. It is too weak to hold them.

> \textit{Bad Code:} "I bought milk, it was expensive."

### The Fix Kit: P-S-C
Use the **P-S-C** method to repair run-ons:

1.  **P - Period (The Hard Stop):**
    *   Separate them completely.
    *   \textit{Result:} "The model is accurate\textbf{.} It predicts floods well."
2.  **S - Semicolon (The Soft Link):**
    *   Link related ideas with a semicolon + transition.
    *   \textit{Result:} "The model is accurate\textbf{; therefore,} it predicts floods well."
3.  **C - Conjunction (The Glue):**
    *   Use a comma + FANBOYS (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So).
    *   \textit{Result:} "The model is accurate\textbf{, so} it predicts floods well."

## The S-W-A-P Matrix (Vocabulary) {-}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=pBlue!10, colframe=pBlue, title=\textbf{The Standard}]
\textbf{Rule:} If you say it in a text message, \textbf{SWAP} it for the Academic Standard.
\end{tcolorbox}

### Tier 1: The "Lazy Words" Swap
These words are vague fillers. Swap them for precision.

| Informal (Delete This) | Formal (Write This) | The Upgrade Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **So** | Extremely / Very | "The results were \textbf{extremely} significant." |
| **Just** | Only / Simply | "The study used \textbf{only} two variables." |
| **Way / A lot** | Many / Much | "The error was \textbf{much} lower." |
| **Kind of** | Somewhat | "The trend was \textbf{somewhat} linear." |
| **Big** | Significant | "The difference was \textbf{significant}." |
| **Good** | Robust | "The method proved \textbf{robust}." |
| **Bad** | Poor | "The data quality was \textbf{poor}." |

### Tier 2: The "Chatty Words" Swap
These words sound like speech. Swap them for writing.

| Informal (Delete This) | Formal (Write This) | The Upgrade Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Get** | Obtain / Receive | "We \textbf{obtained} the satellite data." |
| **Of course** | Clearly / Evidently | "The pattern \textbf{clearly} indicates stress." |
| **Awesome** | Incredible | "The accuracy was \textbf{incredible}." |
| **Again and Again** | Repeatedly | "The test failed \textbf{repeatedly}." |
| **Whole** | Entire | "The \textbf{entire} study area." |
| **Kids** | Children | "The \textbf{children} were surveyed." |
| **Show** | Illustrate | "Figure 1 \textbf{illustrates} the trend." |
| **Look at** | Examine | "We \textbf{examined} the samples." |
| **Talk about** | Discuss | "This section \textbf{discusses} the results." |

### Tier 3: The "Weak Links" Swap
These phrases dilute your authority.

| Informal (Delete This) | Formal (Write This) | The Upgrade Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On the other hand** | Contrastingly | "\textbf{Contrastingly}, the new method is faster." |
| **Got to** | Must / Need to | "We \textbf{must} verify the data." |
| **Ask** | Enquire | "We will \textbf{enquire} about the dataset." |
| **Used to** | Accustomed to | "The system is \textbf{accustomed to} noise." |
| **In a nutshell** | Briefly | "\textbf{Briefly}, the process involves..." |
| **Lots of** | Numerous | "There are \textbf{numerous} factors." |
| **Sort of** | Partially | "The hypothesis was \textbf{partially} supported." |

## The B-R-I-D-G-E System (Transitions) {-}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=pBlue!10, colframe=pBlue, title=\textbf{The Flow Rule}]
\textbf{Rule:} Never leave a sentence stranded. Build a \textbf{BRIDGE} to the next idea.
\end{tcolorbox}

### Bridge Types
Select the right bridge for your logic path:

*   **(+) THE ADDER:** Adds more of the same.
    *   *Code:* **In addition, Moreover, Furthermore.**
    *   *Example:* "The data is accurate. **Moreover,** it is open-source."
*   **(-) THE CONTRASTER:** Changes direction.
    *   *Code:* **However, Conversely, Although, In contrast.**
    *   *Example:* "The layout is good. **However,** the text is too small."
*   **(=) THE RESULT:** Shows the output.
    *   *Code:* **Therefore, Consequently, Thus, As a result.**
    *   *Example:* "It rained heavily. **Consequently,** the river flooded."
*   **(>) THE SEQUENCER:** Shows order.
    *   *Code:* **First, Next, Finally.**
    *   *Example:* "**First,** we clean the data. **Next,** we analyze it."

### The Punctuation Key
When using a Bridge Word, remember the Punctuation Code:

> **[Punctuator] + [Bridge Word] + [Comma]**

*   \textit{Option A:} The test failed\textbf{. However,} we tried again.
*   \textit{Option B:} The test failed\textbf{; however,} we tried again.

## The A-C-T-I-V-E Switch (Voice) {-}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=pBlue!10, colframe=pBlue, title=\textbf{The Agency Rule}]
\textbf{Rule:} Focus on the \textbf{Actor}, not the Action. Active voice creates stronger, clearer sentences.
\end{tcolorbox}

### The Passive Trap
Passive voice makes sentences weak and wordy. It hides who is doing the work.

> \textit{Weak Code:} "The survey was conducted by the research team."
>
> \textbf{Critique:} The actor (team) is at the end. It lacks energy.

### The Active Fix
Flip the sentence. Put the actor first.

> \textit{Strong Code:} "The research team conducted the survey."
>
> \textbf{Why:} It is direct, concise, and powerful.

### When to use Passive?
Only use passive when the actor is unknown, irrelevant, or obvious.
*   \textit{Correct:} "The samples were stored at -20°C." (Who stored them doesn't matter; the temperature matters).

## The P-A-R-A-L-L-E-L Rails (Consistency) {-}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=pBlue!10, colframe=pBlue, title=\textbf{The Pattern Rule}]
\textbf{Rule:} Items in a list or comparison must follow the same grammatical pattern (noun-noun, verb-verb).
\end{tcolorbox}

### The Mismatch Error
Mixing verbs, nouns, and phrases breaks the flow and confuses the reader.

> \textit{Bad Code:} "The goals are to reduce waste, increasing efficiency, and cost management."
>
> \textbf{Error:} Three distinct forms (Infinitive phrase, Gerund, Noun phrase).

### The Parallel Fix
Make them match. Align the rails.

> \textit{Good Code:} "The goals are to \textbf{reduce} waste, \textbf{increase} efficiency, and \textbf{manage} costs." (All Verbs).
>
> \textit{Alternative:} "The goals are waste reduction, efficiency increase, and cost management." (All Nouns).
