# Fluency Tips

Fluency is the ability to speak smoothly without too many pauses or hesitations.

## How to Improve Fluency

1. **Stop Translating**: Translating from your native language slows you down. Practice thinking directly in English.
2. **Learn Phrases, Not Just Words**: Learning "chunks" of language (collocations) helps you speak faster.
    - Instead of learning "make" and "decision" separately, learn "make a decision".
3. **Accept Imperfection**: Don't be afraid of making mistakes. The goal is communication, not perfection.
4. **Talk to Yourself**: Narrate your day. "I am making coffee now. I need a spoon."
5. **Listen More**: Good inputs lead to good outputs. Listen to podcasts and videos daily.

## Daily Practice Routine

- **Morning**: Listen to an English podcast for 10 minutes.
- **During the Day**: Narrate 5 actions you take.
- **Evening**: Write a short journal entry or speak for 1 minute about your day.
