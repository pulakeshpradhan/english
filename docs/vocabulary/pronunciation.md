# English Pronunciation

Pronunciation is often the biggest barrier to fluency. Even if your grammar is perfect, incorrect pronunciation can make you hard to understand.

## Common Pronunciation Challenges

1. **Th Sound**: The 'th' sound can be voiced (as in *this*) or unvoiced (as in *think*).
2. **R vs. L**: Particularly difficult for speakers of Asian languages.
3. **V vs. W**: The 'v' sound requires top teeth specifically on the bottom lip.
4. **Silent Letters**: English has many silent letters (e.g., *knight*, *psychology*, *doubt*).

## Tips for Better Pronunciation

- **Shadowing**: Listen to a native speaker and repeat exactly what they say.
- **Record Yourself**: Compare your recording to the original.
- **Focus on Stress**: English is a stress-timed language. Word stress changes the meaning.
