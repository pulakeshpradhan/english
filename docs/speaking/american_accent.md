Tips and exercises to soften your accent and adopt an American pronunciation style.

From the [American Accent Training Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzVm1SmjPKc_OnC56Bb5G2jhqDA_UNAOZ).

## Core Sounds

### 1. The American R

Unlike British English, the American R is always pronounced clearly at the end of words (*car*, *door*).

### 2. T-Flapping

When 'T' is between two vowels, it often sounds like a soft 'D'.

- *Water* -> *Wader*
- *Better* -> *Bedder*

### 3. Vowel Modifications

Certain vowels change slightly, e.g., the 'flat a' in *cat* or *bath*.

### 4. Intonation

American English often has a different "melody" or rhythm. Pay attention to pitch changes.

Practice by listening and repeating (Shadowing).
