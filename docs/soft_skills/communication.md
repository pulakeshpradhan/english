# Communication & Body Language

Your body language and tone of voice can communicate more than your words.

## Key Tips from Learn English Lab

### 1. Eye Contact

- Maintain comfortable eye contact. Too little shows shyness or dishonesty; too much can be aggressive.

### 2. Posture

- Stand tall and open. Avoid crossing arms which can seem defensive.

### 3. Voice Tone

- Vary your pitch to sound engaged. A monotone voice is boring and hard to follow.

### 4. Active Listening

- Nod and use small verbal cues ("I see", "uh-huh") to show you are listening.

These skills are universal but especially important when communicating in a second language where you might feel less confident.
